## üìò Executive Summary

**Cyber Threat Intelligence Report - July 2025**

**1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the cyber threat landscape observed during July 2025.  Analysis reveals a predominance of vulnerability exploits, primarily targeting Nigeria, with a notable concentration in Lagos.  While several malware families were detected, their overall prevalence remains relatively low compared to the volume of vulnerability-related incidents.  Significant data quality issues, particularly regarding geolocation, require immediate attention.  Key findings highlight the need for enhanced vulnerability management practices and improved data collection methodologies.

**2. Monitoring Summary, C2 IP Analysis, Malware, and Affected Regions**

During July 2025, our threat intelligence platform detected a total of 36,030 threat indicators (TIDs) associated with 11,600 unique IP addresses.  As shown in Figure 1 ("plots/threat_categories_bar.png"), vulnerability-related threats constituted the largest category (10,430 TIDs, 4502 unique IPs), followed by blacklist (9600 TIDs, 2410 unique IPs) and sinkhole (7000 TIDs, 4627 unique IPs) events.  Figure 2 ("plots/threat_categories_doughnut.png") further illustrates the proportional distribution of these threat categories.

The most affected region was 'Ng' (Nigeria), accounting for 10,430 TIDs and 4502 unique IPs (Figure 3, "plots/regions.png").  Lagos followed closely with 9281 TIDs and 3741 unique IPs.  A substantial number of TIDs (5000) originated from "Unverified" regions, highlighting a critical data quality concern.

Analysis of Command and Control (C2) infrastructure (Figure 4, "plots/c2_ips.png") revealed that "Windows" systems were the most frequently targeted (3071 unique instances), followed by 178.162.217.107 (351 unique instances), 5.79.71.225 (336 unique instances), 178.162.203.226 (281 unique instances), and 5.79.71.205 (270 unique instances).

The most prevalent malware families included Andromeda (85 events, 85 unique IPs), Gamut (68 events, 64 unique IPs), Mirai (38 events, 28 unique IPs), Stealrat (6 events, 5 unique IPs), and Cutwail (2 events, 1 unique IP) (Figure 5, "plots/malware.png").


**3. Key Findings Snapshot**

```html
<h3>Key Findings Snapshot</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vulnerability Exploits Dominate:</strong> Vulnerability-related threats represent the largest threat category, highlighting the need for robust vulnerability management.</li>
  <li><strong>Nigeria as Primary Target:</strong> Nigeria, particularly Lagos, experienced the highest concentration of threats.</li>
  <li><strong>Windows Systems Predominantly Affected:</strong> The high number of Windows-related C2 IPs indicates potential vulnerabilities within Windows environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Low Malware Prevalence:</strong> While several malware families were detected, their overall impact remains relatively low compared to vulnerability exploits.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Quality Issues:</strong> A significant number of events originated from "Unverified" regions, indicating a need for improved data collection and geolocation accuracy.</li>
</ul>
```

**4. Actionable Recommendations**

* **Enhance Vulnerability Management:** Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program, including regular patching and security assessments, focusing on identified vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
* **Improve Data Quality:** Prioritize improving the accuracy of geolocation data within the threat intelligence platform.  Investigate the root cause of the "Unverified" region issue.
* **Strengthen Network Security:** Implement robust network security measures, including intrusion detection/prevention systems and firewalls, to mitigate the impact of identified threats.
* **Malware Analysis and Response:** Conduct in-depth analysis of detected malware samples to understand their capabilities and develop effective countermeasures.
* **Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for threats based on the identified indicators of compromise (IOCs) and observed attack patterns.


**5.  Appendix (Advisories)**

The following advisories were issued during July 2025:

* **FAKE-001:** Simulated Zero-Day in Browser (Vulnerability, Critical Impact, Allows RCE, 2025-06-24)
* **FAKE-002:** Banking Trojan Campaign (Malware, High Impact, Banking info theft, 2025-06-23)

## üß© Key Findings Snapshot

* **Vulnerability Exploits Dominate:**  Vulnerability-related threats account for 10,430 events (4502 unique IPs), the highest among threat categories, exceeding Blacklist (9600 events) and Sinkhole (7000 events) threats.

* **Nigeria is the Primary Target:**  The region 'Ng' (Nigeria) shows the highest concentration of threats with 10,430 events (4502 unique IPs), followed by Lagos (9281 events).  A significant number of events (5000) are from 'Unverified' regions, indicating a data quality issue.

* **Windows OS is the Most Affected:**  The top Command and Control (C2) IP address is associated with the Windows operating system (3071 unique instances), highlighting a potential vulnerability in Windows systems.

* **Low Prevalence of Major Malware:** Andromeda (85 events), Gamut (68 events), and Mirai (38 events) are the most prevalent malware, but their overall numbers are relatively low compared to the total number of events.

* **Data Quality Concerns:** The high number of events from "Unverified" regions suggests a need to improve data collection and geolocation accuracy.
